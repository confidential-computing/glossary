# Confidential Computing Consortium Glossary

Welcome to the Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC) Glossary. Our mission is to facilitate a common understanding of confidential computing concepts, terms, and definitions. This glossary is a community-driven effort to make confidential computing more accessible and understandable to everyone.

## Introduction

Confidential computing protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based, attested execution environment. This glossary aims to support the CCC's goal of fostering widespread adoption of confidential computing by providing clear, concise definitions of related terminology.

## How to Use This Glossary

The glossary is organized alphabetically with terms related to confidential computing. Each term includes a definition, context for use, and references for further exploration. This resource is intended for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of confidential computing, from students to professionals.
